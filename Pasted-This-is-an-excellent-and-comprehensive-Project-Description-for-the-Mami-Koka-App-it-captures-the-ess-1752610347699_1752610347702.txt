Mami Koka App â€“ Project Description

Overview

Mami Koka is an innovative mobile application designed to empower everyday people with access to quick jobs, digital finance tools, event services, and a local marketplace. It bridges the gap between unemployment and opportunity by creating a practical, user-friendly ecosystem where users can post and find jobs, complete tasks for money, withdraw earnings, and engage in commerceâ€”all from a mobile phone.

Targeted primarily at informal workers, freelancers, small-scale service providers, and digital-savvy users in urban and semi-urban areas, Mami Koka is especially beneficial for youth, women, and low-income earners often excluded from formal employment.
